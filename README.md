# Portofolio_dibimbing
latihan membuat project pertama
this is my first github repo that i created to show my first project in data science. I know there are many things which should be improved. but since this is my first project, I confident enough to publish it in this site. hopefully in the future my project will getting better and better.

the seoul bike sharing demand prediction is a project that i finished during my bootcamp at dibimbing.id. others projects are not as big as this project since i created for the purpose of adding my portfolio. 
the dataset for this project is downloaded from UCI machine learning repository. the type of machine learning is regression problem. I tested more than 5 machine learning alghorithms to better predict the target variables. some of my model includes hyperparameter tuning.
